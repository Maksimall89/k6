k6 v0.38.0 is here! ðŸŽ‰

## New Features!

### Accessing the consolidated and derived options from the default function ([2493](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2493))

The `k6/execution` core module now lets you access the [consolidated and derived](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/options/#where-to-set-options) options that k6 computed before it started executing the test. You can access consolidated options through the `exec.test.options` property. Note that consolidated options are frozen and cannot be modified.

```javascript
import exec from 'k6/execution';

export const options = {
  vus: 10,
  duration : '30s'
};

export default function() {
  console.log(exec.test.options.scenarios.default.vus) // 10
}
```

### Dumping SSL keys to an NSS formatted key log file ([2487](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2487))

This release adds the ability to dump SSL keys while making TLS connections.
You can then can use these keys to decrypt the whole traffic that k6 generates. 

To do this, set the `SSLKEYLOGFILE` to some file path and run k6.
This will populate the file with the keys.
Then you can use Wireshark to capture the traffic, decrypt it, and use that for debugging. 

[Here's an example that uses curl to inspect TLS traffic](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/01/15/inspect-curls-tls-traffic/).

### AWS JSLib

There's a new addition to the officially supported k6 JavaScript libraries: [k6-jslib-aws](https://github.com/grafana/k6-jslib-aws).
This library lets users interact with a selection of AWS services directly from their scrips. The library currently implements support for the [S3](https://k6.io/docs/javascript-api/jslib/aws/s3client/) and the [Secrets Manager](https://k6.io/docs/javascript-api/jslib/aws/secretsmanagerclient/) services.

[The AWS JS lib documentaion](https://k6.io/docs/javascript-api/jslib/aws) has examples and details on how to use the library in your own scripts.
###  Tagging by stages

A few helper functions have been added to the [k6-jslib-utils](https://k6.io/docs/javascript-api/jslib/utils) library for tagging automatically all the metric's samples with the current running stage.
## Breaking Changes

### `console.log` and `console.info` pretty prints objects and arrays ([2375](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2375))

For convenience, all `console` methods such as `console.log` and `console.info` will now automatically `JSON.stringify` objects and arrays passed to it. Thus, instead of `console.log({'foo': 'bar'})` printing `[object Object]`, it will now print `{'foo': 'bar'}`, which will make the experience of debugging k6 scripts easier and more intuitive. 

The previous behavior can still be achieved by casting the `Object` to a `String`, as in `console.log(String({'foo': 'bar'}))`.  

**Objects**

```javascript
export default function () {
  var user = [{}]

  console.log("the user", user) 
  // before: the user [object Object]
  // after: the user {"name":"Bob"}
}
```

**arrays**

```javascript
export default function () {
  var user = {name: "Bob"}

  console.log([1, 2, "mytest", {user: "Bob"}]) 
  // before: 1,2,mytest,[object Object]
  // after: [1,2,"mytest",{"user":"Bob"}]
}
```

### Deprecations

* [2499](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2499/files) removed support for the deprecated max VU's `max` **option**.
* This release drops some left overs from the previous version of our JS module APIs. As of **v0.38-0**, these are now unsupported:
  * The deprecated `common.Bind` ([2488](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2448)) and `common.BindToGlobal` ([2451](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2451)) functions.
  * The context-based (`common/context.go` [2488](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2448)) utils have also been removed. 
   
## Enhancements and UX improvements

### Stricter thresholds' evaluation before the execution starts ([#2330](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/2330))

k6 **v0.37.0** already improved thresholds parsing by switching its underlying implementation from JavaScript to Go. k6 **v0.38.0** introduces two additional improvements:
* k6 will now parse and evaluate thresholds before the execution starts. If a threshold is invalid, as described below, k6 will immediately exit without starting the load test. 
* k6 will now detect invalid thresholds:
    ```javascript
    export const options = {
      // ...    
      thresholds: {
          // Incorrect thresholds expressions:
          http_req_failed: ['rave<0.01'],  // e.g. "rave" is not a valid aggregation method
          // Thresholds applying to a non-existing metrics:
          iDoNotExist: ['p(95)<200'], // e.g. the metric 'iDoNotExist' does not exist
          // Thresholds applying an aggregation method that's unsupported by the metric they apply to:          
          my_counter: ['p(95)<200'], // Counter metrics do not support the p() aggregation method
     },
    };

### Disabling colors ([2410](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2410))

k6 output colors can now be disabled. Following the *NO_COLOR* standard, setting the `NO_COLOR` or `K6_NO_COLOR` environment variables let you disable the ANSI color escape codes.

```bash
# No color output
K6_NO_COLOR=true k6 run script.js

# No color output
NO_COLOR= k6 run script.js
```

### Support for encrypted TLS private keys

Now you can use passphrase-protected private keys when authenticating with TLS. Using the `password` property of an options' `tlsAuth` object, you can now indicate the passphrase to use to decrypt a private key. Note that this support is limited to the scope of [RFC1423](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1423) and does not support PKCS8 keys, as they're not yet supported by the golang standard library. 

```javascript
export const options = {
  tlsAuth: [
    {
      domains: ['example.com'],
      cert: open('mycert.pem'),
      key: open('mycert-key.pem'),
      password: 'mycert-passphrase',
    },
  ],
};
```

Thanks, @Gabrielopesantos, for the [contribution](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2488).

### Improve JSON output's performance ([2436](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2436))

The JSON output was optimized and now should around 2x as more performant at outputting metrics.  This means that it either will be able to export twice as many metrics and/or to use half the resources to do the same amount of metrics. As a side effect, there is a slight breaking change in which the `tags` field is no longer sorted, while it was previously.

### Treat panics as interrupt errors ([2453](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2453))

We changed the behavior of how k6 treats Go panics, which may happen because of bugs in k6 or in a JavaScript k6 extension. Previously, the behavior was to catch the panic and log it as an error. Starting with **v0.38.0**, whenever k6 observes a Go panic, it logs an error like before, but more importantly, it will abort the script execution and cause k6 to exit with a non-0 exit code. This will help extension authors to identify issues in their extensions more easily. 

### Miscellaneous

* [2411](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2411) The k6 command-line UI (logo, test description and progerss bars) can now effectively be disabled using the [`--quiet`](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/options/#quiet) flag.
* [2429](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2429) `lib/types` now exposes the source of the `NullHostnameTrie` to simplify access to an original list of the hostnames.

* [#2484](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2484) moved out in a new dedicated Go `lib/netext/grpcext` package all the parts not strictly required from the `js/k6/net/grpc` module for binding the gRPC operations and the JavaScript runtime. It facilitates the development of extensions based on gRPC without the direct dependency on the `goja` runtime. Furthermore, the new [Dial](https://github.com/grafana/k6/blob/bef458906f6884a99843573223028981c0a8b8db/lib/netext/grpcext/conn.go#L72-L81) function accepts a [grpc.DialOption](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc@v1.45.0#DialOption) variadic for customizing the dialing operation.

## Extensions

### Event loop testing

With this release, you can [export the event loop](https://pkg.go.dev/go.k6.io/k6/js/eventloop) added in v0.37.0. This lets extensions developers test event-loop-dependant APIs.

There were also updates to [modulestest.VU](https://pkg.go.dev/go.k6.io/k6/js/modulestest#VU) to support the new API. Head to GitHub to [see it in action](https://github.com/grafana/k6/tree/master/cmd/integration_tests/testmodules/events).


## Bugs Fixed!

* [2456](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2456): Fixed a very unlikely panic involving arrival rate executors and execution segments with very low VU counts.
* [2349](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2349): Thanks to @rainingmaster it is now possible to leave the options' tlsAuth `domains` property empty.
* [1346](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/1346): Thresholds over custom metrics for which no data was collected will now be evaluated.
* [2390](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2390): Thresholds over custom (+tagged) metrics will now return the appropriate results. 
* [2480](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2480): Fixed an error occuring when passing the `data` property of an `http.file` as a request body.


## Known issues

* @hecnavsanz [reported to us](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/2500) that in certain scenarios, k6's UI might inacurately report a test as failed :x: when it actually succeeded :white_check_mark:. This is caused by some concurrency issue in our codebase that only affects the report's UI, and has no impact on the actual test result. A [fix](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2502) is in the works, but won't be ready for this version. We expect to ship it with the next k6 release instead.
